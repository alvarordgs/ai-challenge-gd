# 🛒 AI Challenge GD - Seller Transaction Prediction

Welcome to the **AI Challenge GD** project! This repository is dedicated to predicting when a seller will make a transaction. Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions and insights.

## 📋 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:
- Analyze historical transaction data
- Build predictive models to forecast future transactions
- Evaluate model performance and optimize for accuracy

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-challenge-gd.git
    cd ai-challenge-gd
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the initial setup:**
    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```

## 📊 Data

The dataset used in this project includes historical transaction records of sellers. It contains features such as:
- Seller ID
- Transaction date
- Transaction amount
- Product category

## 🛠️ Models

We will experiment with various machine learning models, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Evaluation

Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)
